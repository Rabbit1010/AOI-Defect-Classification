Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown great results in the field of image classification. The convolutional layers is naturally suitable for images, since it acts like feature extraction in images. In this project, we use CNN to classify optical defects into different categories.

We construct and train a new CNN model. The CNN consists of 3 convolution layers and 2 fully-connected layers (fig). The 3x3 kernel size of the convolutional layers is inspired by VGG-Net, which showed that 3x3 convolution kernel is standard in image classification CNNs. Also, we use random search to optimize the hyperparameters, including layers count, node count and learning rate. Also, drop out layers are added the make the training more stable.

In the optical defect dataset, the categories is imbalanced. The CNN would refuse to predict the smaller categories. Therefore, we try to resample the smaller categories by naively oversampling them, so that the CNN have more training samples in those smaller categories. However, naively oversampling cause the categories to converge in different speed; one categories may begin to overfit while the others may still be under-fitting. Therefore, we conclude that naicely oversampling would not work, and turn to image augmentation.

Image Augmentation were used on both training and validation datasets. The augmentation includes vertical and horizontal flip, and padding. After the augmentation, the dataset is approximately 20 times larger than the original dataset. By largening the dataset, we can prevent overfitting, and make the training more stable.
