# AOI-Defect-Classification
Final project of Digital Image Processing.
Please see ![Report](./Final_report.pdf) for more details.

# Classification
* Run ```train_and_eval.py``` to train the CNN. Trained model is stored in ```checkpoints/model_final.h5```.
* Run ```Predict.py``` to predict all testing data using the specify CNN model.
* Exact CNN model can be viewed in ```CNN_Structure.py```

# Segmentation
* Run the corresponding .m file.
  1. ```Void.m```
  2. ```Horizontal.m```
  3. ```Vertical.m```
  4. ```Edge.m```
  5. ```Particle.m```
